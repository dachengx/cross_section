	abstract = {Solar neutrino measurements from 1258 days of data from the Super-Kamiokande detector are presented. The measurements are based on recoil electrons in the energy range 5.0-20.0MeV. The measured solar neutrino flux is 2.32 +- 0.03(stat.) +0.08-0.07(sys.)*10{\textasciicircum}6cm{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}, which is 45.1+-0.5(stat.)+1.6-1.4(sys.)\% of that predicted by the BP2000 SSM. The day vs night flux asymmetry is 0.033+-0.022(stat.)+0.013-0.012(sys.). The recoil electron energy spectrum is consistent with no spectral distortion ({\textbackslash}chi{\textasciicircum}2/d.o.f. = 19.0/18). The seasonal variation of the flux is consistent with that expected from the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit ({\textbackslash}chi{\textasciicircum}2/d.o.f. = 3.7/7). For the hep neutrino flux, we set a 90\% C.L. upper limit of 40 *10{\textasciicircum}3cm{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}, which is 4.3 times the BP2000 SSM prediction.},

	abstract = {The coherent elastic scattering of neutrinos off nuclei has eluded detection for four decades, even though its predicted cross-section is the largest by far of all low-energy neutrino couplings. This mode of interaction provides new opportunities to study neutrino properties, and leads to a miniaturization of detector size, with potential technological applications. We observe this process at a 6.7-sigma confidence level, using a low-background, 14.6-kg CsI[Na] scintillator exposed to the neutrino emissions from the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Characteristic signatures in energy and time, predicted by the Standard Model for this process, are observed in high signal-to-background conditions. Improved constraints on non-standard neutrino interactions with quarks are derived from this initial dataset.},

	abstract = {A survey has been made of the differential scattering cross sections for 187-Mev electrons on the even-even nuclei 12Mg24, 14Si28, 16S32, 18A40, and 28Sr88. It has been possible to separate the elastic scattering from the inelastic in all cases and to resolve the inelastic groups from specific nuclear levels for at least one level in all cases. A simple Born-approximation analysis of the elastic data yields values of the effective radii and surface thicknesses of the nuclear charge densities which (if suitably corrected for failure of the Born approximation) are in substantial agreement with the results of Hahn, Ravenhall, and Hofstadter; i.e., a radius parameter of c≅1.08 A13×10−13 cm (radius to half-maximum of the charge distribution) and a surface thickness of t≅2.5×10−13 cm (thickness from 10\% to 90\% of the maximum of the charge distribution). Phenomenological analysis of the inelastic scattering along the lines laid down by Schiff yields some tentative multipolarity assignments, and application of some results of Ravenhall yields estimates of (radiative) partial level widths; for the E2 transitions these correspond to lifetimes of ∼19×10−13 sec (Mg 1.37 Mev) to ∼1.4×10−13 sec (Sr 1.85 Mev). The observed strengths of the transitions are compared to those predicted by Weisskopf theory.},
