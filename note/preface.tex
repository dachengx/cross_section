\firstword{T}{he} calculation of cross section in particle physics and nuclear physics is crucial for both
theoretical and experimental research. However, the detailed derivation of results in literatures are always omitted for simplicity.
This handbook is designed to record the required assumptions and derivation procedure of important cross sections
for students with basic knowledge of quantum field theory. It is also a record of learning for the author.
